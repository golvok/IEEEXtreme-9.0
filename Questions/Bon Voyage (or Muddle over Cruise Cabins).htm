 TransContinental Ocean-liner Company is celebrating their centennial 
anniversary. As a part of the celebrations, they launched an exciting 
contest for a free, around-the-world cruise on one of their ships.  As 
part of the contest entry, passengers select two cabins in which they 
would like to stay.  If they are a winner, they will be given one of the
 two cabins.</p>

<p>Interest was enormous, and great many people applied to be a part of 
the voyage. Winners will be decided on a lottery. The company does not 
have any control over whom all will win the final lottery or obtain the 
tickets, but only on how many tickets will be distributed.</p>

<p>Jerry, the tour manager, is finding it difficult to find the maximum 
number of prizes that can be awarded. He must make sure that each 
potential winner can be accommodated in one of the cabins that they 
specified when they entered the contest.  </p>

<p>Your job is to find the maximum number of prizes that can be awarded 
subject to this constraint. Help Jerry to find a solution for his 
problem and earn some real good points for yourselves!</p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>The input begins with an integer <em>T</em>, 1 &lt;= <em>T</em> &lt;= 15, indicated the number of test cases.</p>

<p>Each test case consists of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A line containing an integer <em>N</em>, 2 &lt;= <em>N</em> &lt;= 200, where <em>N</em> is the total number of rooms on the ship.</p></li>
<li><p>A line containing an integer <em>M</em>, 0 &lt;= <em>M</em> &lt;= 500, where <em>M</em> are the number of people who signed up.</p></li>
<li><p>Next come <em>M</em> lines, the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> line containing the pair of cabins selected by the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> entrant in the contest.  The cabin choices will be two space-separated integers, each falling between 1 and <em>N</em> (inclusive).</p></li>
</ul></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>For
 each test case, you should output, on a line by itself, the maximum 
number of tickets that can be awarded such that every winner can be 
housed in one of the two cabins that they have selected.</p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p></p><pre>5

<p>In the 2nd test case, 3 people opted for the same 1 or 2 cabins, and 
in order to prevent the worst case of all the 3 of them getting the 
ticket, we can give out at most 2 tickets.</p>

<p>In the 3th test case, we can give out 3 tickets and still make sure 
that regardless of who gets a ticket, any winner can be housed in a 
cabin of their choice.</p></div>
