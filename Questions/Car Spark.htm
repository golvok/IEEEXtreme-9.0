                <div class="msB"><p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>John
 is a computer programmer and is highly known for his achievements in 
his field. In addition to being a passionate software professional, he 
is also passionate about motorcars and motorbikes.</p>

<p>So, after ending his successful and lengthy software career, he 
decides to take up his passion. He starts an organization by the name 
"Car Spark" (CS). CS is an organization from which you can rent luxury 
cars of your choice on an hourly rental basis. </p>

<p>CS would like to accept bookings for the weekend in advance, and then
 decide which bookings to process based on the profits that would be 
earned.  When placing an order, customers quote the amount that they are
 willing to pay for that vehicle during that particular timespan. Since a
 car can only be given to one customer during a particular time period, 
CS must be careful about which bookings to process.  </p>

<p>Initially CS has only one vehicle available for rent.  To be the 
first hire for CS, you must develop a program to maximize revenue on 
bookings for this vehicle. </p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>Input begins with a single integer <em>T</em>, 1 &lt;= <em>T</em> &lt;= 100, which denotes number of test cases.</p>

<p>Each test case begins with a single integer <em>N</em>, 1 &lt;= <em>N</em> &lt;= 2000, which is the number of bookings John received. </p>

<p>The remainder of the test case consists of <em>N</em> lines containing three integers <em>B<sub>s</sub></em>, <em>B<sub>e</sub></em>, and <em>A<sub>i</sub></em> each separated by a space, where <em>B<sub>s</sub></em> is the booking start time, <em>B<sub>e</sub></em> is the booking end time, and <em>A<sub>i</sub></em> is the amount that the customer is willing to spend for the entire booking.  Note that 0 &lt;= <em>B<sub>s</sub></em> &lt; <em>B<sub>e</sub></em> &lt;= 48 and 1 &lt;= <em>A<sub>i</sub></em> &lt;= 100000.</p>

<p>Note:  The car may only be rented during the weekend, meaning from 
12:00 AM on Saturday to 12:00 AM on Monday. Since the two days in the 
weekend have 48 hours, 12 noon on a Sunday would be the (24+12) 36th 
hour. Similarly, if the booking start time is 10:00 PM on Saturday and 
the booking end time is 12:00 AM on Sunday, then <em>B<sub>s</sub></em> would be 22 and <em>B<sub>e</sub></em> would be 24. </p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>You are to output a single line for each test case, giving the maximum revenue John can make from the orders he received.</p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><pre><code>2

</code></pre></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><pre><code>3700
2000
</code></pre></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>For
 the first test case, for the time slot 1-3 maximum revenue John can 
make is 2100 (Max(100+200, 2100)) and for slot 3-4 he can make 1600. The
 maximum total revenue is 3700 (2100+1600).</p>

<p>Similarly for second test case, the maximum revenue he can generate is 2000.</p></div>
