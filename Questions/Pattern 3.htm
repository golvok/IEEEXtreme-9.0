 the bear received a digital signal pattern generator that his brother 
Mitsos built. The generator produces a signal that is encoded using the 
Latin alphabet. Vangelis starts the generator for some time and records 
the signal generated. He wants to study the sample he received and try 
to identify the smallest pattern that the generator could be using to 
generate the sample.  </p>

<p>Your task is to help Vangelis by writing a program that will calculate the length of the smallest valid pattern.</p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>The input is made up of multiple test cases.</p>

<p>The first line contains an integer <em>T</em> (1 &lt;= <em>T</em> &lt;= 10), the number of test cases in this file.</p>

<p>Each line contains an encoded signal. The signal is encoded using the
 small letters of the Latin alphabet. The length of a signal is between 1
 and 10<sup>6</sup> characters, inclusive.</p>

<p>Vangelis has started the recording at the beginning of a pattern, so 
each line begins with the first character in the pattern.  His recording
 lasts for at least one pattern length, but the length of the recording <strong>may not be an exact multiple of the pattern length</strong>.</p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><p>There must be <em>T</em> lines of output and each line will contain a single non-negative integer number, the length of the minimum valid pattern.</p></div><div class="msB"><p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p></div><div class="msB"><pre><code>6
